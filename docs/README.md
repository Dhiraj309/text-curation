# text-curation Documentation

This directory contains **design- and behavior-level documentation**
for the `text-curation` library.

These documents describe:

- The design philosophy and invariants of the system
- The responsibilities and guarantees of each block
- The behavioral contract of built-in profiles
- Planned future work and explicit non-goals

These docs are intentionally **specification-oriented**, not tutorials.

For installation instructions, examples, and high-level usage,
see the main [README](../README.md).
